# Governance

Governance of the project is simple and straightforward:

- **Maintainers** make consensus driven decisions about the project.
- The **Benevolent Dictator** has the final say on all decisions but generally only exercises this  power on an as-needed basis, most usually when the maintainers cannot  reach consensus.
