## v0.5.0 (FUTURE)

* Changed internal service image for the `node` service. Developers working on Conifer will need to rebuild with `lando rebuild -ys node`. This change does not affect production/library code.
* Fixed a bug in `Site::find-file()` [#76](https://github.com/sitecrafting/conifer/issues/76)
