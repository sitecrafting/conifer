* Create instructional videos
* Write examples and documentation
* [Report issues](https://github.com/sitecrafting/conifer/issues) or commenting on existing issues: **we want to hear from you!**

## Bug Fixes and New Features

Of course, new contributions in the form of code are welcome too, *especially* while Conifer is in its early days! ðŸ‘¶ To do that, just head over to GitHub and start a discussion in a new issue, or create a Pull Request.

**Before making a pull request, please familiarize yourself with the [Testing docs](/testing.md).** It's a good idea to also be aware of the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.md) (TL;DR: don't be a jerk).

If you're wondering how best to set up Conifer to work on the source code, check out [Development Setup](/dev-setup.md).
