## Documentation

For reference documentation, use-cases, and design principles, check out the [docs on Gitbook](https://www.coniferplug.in/).

## Quick start

See the [Installation docs](https://www.coniferplug.in/getting-started/installation) to get Conifer installed for use in your theme or plugin.

## Issues

Please submit issues directly to GitHub. We need guidance from the community about how people would like to use Conifer!

## Development

**To get started hacking on Conifer itself, first install [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/),** the official dev environment for Conifer and sole system requirement for developing Conifer.

Then, just clone the repo and start up the dev environment:

```
git clone git@github.com:sitecrafting/conifer.git
cd conifer
lando start
```

Follow the prompts and you should have a local WordPress site running Conifer
and its companion starter theme, [Groot](https://github.com/sitecrafting/groot)!

**NOTE: there is currently a known issue with how Lando sets up pretty permalinks. They won't work before you configure them manually.**
